# Kid's Happiness
### A full stack application designed, implemented and presented by a team of 5 for the class Software technologies. 
### A project designed to make easier for the parents to find all kinds of activities for their children.

This project is implemented with 2 Interfaces, one for the Parents and one for the activitie providers. 

Both of them are developed with the react framework. 

Both of the apps are communicating with the same backend server that is implemented in Nestjs with a PostgressSQL database. 

For communication, between front and back end we've used a state managment library called Redux. 

That was the main challenge for this project. A completly new technology for us, learning it and using it the best we possibly can.

In addition to that, we also used a open-source framework called Swagger that made easier for us to visualize the API and made possible for the front team and back team to work asynchronously.
